				<h2 class="cont">Here is how you can control your PC/laptop with your 
				Android smartphone/tablet using it either as keyboard or mouse.</h2>
				
				<p class="cont" style="font-family:Calibri">Android OS has increased the 
				overall usage domain of mobile phones
				in a short period of time. Since it is always fun to do the awesome 
				things with your smartphone, we are presenting a new way to use your 
				Android smartphone/tablet. That is as a keyboard or mouse for your PC.<br/><br/>
				Before we begin, you must know this “this process will only work with 
				Intel based PCs”. Now first of all you have to get Android Remote
				Keyboard App and software.<br/><br/>
				How to Set Up Intel Remote Keyboard.
					<ol style="font-family:Calibri">
						<li>Download Intel Remote Keyboard on your Android device or tablet.</li>
						<li>Download and install the Intel Remote Keyboard Host on your Windows 
						PC. You will need to choose x86 or x64 depending on your Windows. If you
						aren’t sure what you are running, there are four easy ways to know if you’re 
						on 64-bit Windows.(Important: Make sure your Android and Windows devices 
						are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.)</li>
						<li>On your Android phone, tap the Windows device name.</li>
						<li>Your Windows PC will now show a large QR code. Just scan it with your
						Android smartphone’s camera (following the on-screen instructions) and the 
						two devices will be paired.</li>
						<li>You’re all set!</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<h3 class="cont">What you can do:</h3>
					<img id="img1" src="7.png" width="650" height="300"/><br/><br/>
					<p class="cont" style="font-family:Calibri">
						The App is basically a virtual trackpad and keyboard for your computer.
						You can use it in portrait or landscape mode.<br/><br/>
						In portrait mode, your screen is divided into the trackpad area on the
						top and keyboard at the bottom. Intel’s keyboard looks much like any 
						Android keyboard, but also has a Windows button, an Esc button, and the four arrow keys.

					<p class="cont" align="center"><i><b>remote keyboard</b></i></p>
					<p style="font-family:Calibri" class="cont"> 
					There could be some enhanced controls to fully optimise the facility. First, there is no 
					“continuous scrolling” , that means you have to touch scroll button many 
					times for scrolling upto a large distance. Second there is no “direct volume control” , 
					since it is always convenient to adjust volume by using a dedicated key than to use mouse. 
					We firmly expect that these features will be added in the upcoming updates.
