	<h1>What is git?</h1>
	<h3 style="color:red">Git Basics</h3>
	<p>So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb,
	because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, 
	then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, 
	try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as Subversion a
	nd Perforce; doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Git stores 
	and thinks about information much differently than these other systems, even though the user 
	interface is fairly similar, and understanding those differences will help prevent you from
	becoming confused while using it.</p><br>
	<h3 style="color:red">The Three States</h3>
	<p>Now, pay attention. This is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of 
	your learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: 
	committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database. 
	Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. 
	Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit 
	snapshot. This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the Git directory, the working 
	directory, and the staging area. Working directory, staging area, and Git directory.
	<br>
	The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. 
	This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository
	from another computer.<br>
	The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of 
	the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
	The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about 
	what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the “index”, but it’s also common to 
	refer to it as the staging area.
	The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
	<ol>
	    <li>You modify files in your working directory.</li>
		<li>You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.</li>
		<li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory</li>
	</ol></p>
